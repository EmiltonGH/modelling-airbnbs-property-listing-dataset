## Project Description

This project involves analyzing Airbnb data to predict various outcomes using machine learning. 
The main aim of the project is to practice data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training using real-world data.
Throughout this project, you will learn how to handle numerical and text data, create training and testing datasets, and build predictive models.
We build a framework to systematically train, tune, and evaluate models on several tasks that are tackled by the Airbnb team.
